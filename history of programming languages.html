<h3 style="color: aliceblue;">The history of programming languages goes from early-mechanical computer documentation to modern software development tools.first programming languages were highly specialized,Centered on mathematical notation and similarly enigmatic syntax.Throughout the 1900's,Research in compiler theory leads to the creation of programming languages of high -level,which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions.Plankalkül was the first high level programming language,Created between 1942 and 1945, by Konrad Zuse.In 1951 Corrado Böhm created the first high-level language to have an associated compiler, for his PhD thesis. The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.
